      <h1>The Road To Myoko</h1>

          Hello there, I’m Sig!
        </p>
        <p>
          Welcome to my website, and to my first blog post! I’ll be posting here periodically so you can follow the road along with me to the Snowshoe World Championships in Myoko, Japan.

          A lot of you are probably wondering what snowshoe racing even is. If you’re reading this, you’ve most likely at least seen a pair of traditional snowshoes before. Snowshoe racing relies on the same concept of wearing large platforms to walk on top of the snow, and takes it to the next level with lightweight material and optimized designs to allow you to run across the snow as fast as possible. It might look a little something like this:

          How would one even discover such an absurd sport? Well when you need to train and stay in shape during the winter and you don’t want to be trapped on a treadmill inside, so you try new things!

          At first, my father would put on some old wooden snowshoes and run in the woods for fun. Soon enough, he found a few races to challenge himself. Then he discovered the National Snowshoe Championship race, and learned that snowshoeing was actually a big deal. When I was 10 years old I was running my first National Snowshoe race in Colorado. It was the hardest yet one of the most fulfilling races I have ever run. The elevation was intense, I felt like I was breathing through a thick blanket.

          So why did I continue to keep running the hardest races and pushing through so much pain training on those Powderhorn blackdiamond ski hills? If God gives you gifts and talents you have to use them. Don’t let them waste away to be forgotten. This is a way for me to connect with God on a higher level and to spend more time with my dad. It is an amazing feeling when you know you’re making your dad proud and giving glory to God.

          I have done many things to train for these races; I’ve sacrificed nights of going out with friends to get enough rest, paid careful attention to my health and nutrition, and ran 5 to 6 days out of the week. I get to meet cool runners who give me inspiration, and I’ve seen that if you truly put your hard work into it, it’ll pay off. In March 2019 I won my first National Championship Snowshoe race, and now I am on the USSSA snowshoe team. I have a once in a lifetime opportunity to travel to Japan to compete in the World Championship Snowshoe race and my goal is to win and be the best in the world!

          I hope you’ll follow along on this journey with me, it would surely help me a great deal if I got lots of support from everyone! Again, I will keep you updated and educated on everything that I’m doing to prepare for this race. This is a big deal to me and my family. I hope you all would spread the word about snowshoeing, it made a huge impact on my family’s life and it only brought us all closer together!
