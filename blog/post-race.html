      <h1>The Road To Myoko</h1>

          Welcome back! This is my third and final blog post involving thanks to sponsors, friends, and family. I want to talk a little more about my experience in Japan and how that opened my eyes to so many new things. Then lastly so many people have been asking what I plan on doing next!
        </p>
        <p>
          I just have to say I am a lucky girl! When I started training and planning for this race I had a vision of getting a few sponsors and trying to get the word out but I had no idea that many people would actually be this excited for me. With that happening it actually made me realize this was a bigger deal than I thought. I am so happy I live in such a supportive town. We have a great community here in Ironwood, Bessemer, and Hurley. My favorite part of coming home was having random people come up to me saying “hey, you’re the girl that ran that snowshoe race!” or when I’m going for runs by my house people will roll down their window and congratulate me. It’s so fun! Thank you SO much everyone. Even if just followed me along on my website or facebook/instagram, thank you so so much. People have no idea how motivating it was for me to run this race with all my support. There was one guy I met in Japan that had to take a picture of all my sponsors because he was so impressed with it. He said he hopes to have half as many by next year!

          Honestly I had no idea what to expect when going over to Japan. I sure didn’t expect to learn as much as I did. My big brother Maxx came along with me and he took care of me the whole trip. I am going to be honest I struggled with the food in Japan. I am not a fish lover, I’ll eat it on occasion but not with every meal like the Japanese do. Everything there tasted a bit different than anything you ever had. It was so foreign to me that I couldn’t like it. So, if you are like me I advise you to pack a lot of oatmeal packets and granola bars, that’s what I did. That honestly got me through some days because I would order something and I would try one bite and feel sick to my stomach. I stuck with plain rice, the things I brought, and some small plain foods I saw. Maxx tried lots of different foods any chance he could get and he had his fair share of good and bad. My favorite thing I had was their pancakes! Those were amazing. The food was the only thing very different.

          There is just a crazy amount of people everywhere you go in Japan. Maxx was very specific to me walking in a straight line and being aware of my surroundings. We had to focus on what we were touching and never touch our faces. We would wash our hands multiple times a day, never wear our shoes past the door when we would go into our rooms. We had to watch out for all of those things the whole time we were there. I would have to say though, Japan keeps their streets, trains, and buildings very clean for how many people use them. I don’t think I could ever live there, the language barrier was harder than I thought it would be but that is very real.

          I have to say I am really happy I tried. If I never would have tried and just quit my training, gave up on going to Japan because of the “coronavirsus” or some excuse I never would have become a World Champion Snowshoer. I hope to inspire others to try because you will never know the outcome until you do. A lot of people always say they want to travel. “I wish I could just quit my job and travel” pretty cliche thing to say. However, I think I understand why people say that now. Traveling is hard, sometimes you go hours without food, sleep, and a shower. Things could go horribly wrong like losing your luggage or being stranded somewhere and don’t know where to go. Maybe in the moment it doesn’t seem amazing but I’ve learned that you almost forget all those bad hungry moments and remember all the good memories. Maxx and I had our tiffs and go abouts but he taught me to be aware and think through things before sitting on a bus, what are the essentials for what you need today, small things that actually matter a lot. I will never forget all the amazing people I got to meet from other countries like Australia, Sweden, Japan, Italy, Spain, and Canada. They shared their experiences with me through traveling and competing in races like these. It was so cool to hear about them and they inspired me to keep doing things like this.

          The next World Championships is in Argentina, I hope to be well prepared and trained because I want to go! Sadly this sport is not yet in the Olympics but they are trying to add it by 2030! I’ll be right in my prime! During the next couple months I am going to keep training, I’ll be running in a half marathon with my mom! It will be her first so I’m excited for her! I hope to travel a bit more, my friend lives in Idaho and only a few hours from Glacier National Park so we hope to go for a weekend! I bet they have great running trails there! Then in August we are going to see my Brother in England and that will be my next out of the country experience so I am SUPER excited about that.
