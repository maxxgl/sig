          Hey guys, welcome back!! I can’t believe there are only a few weeks until the race, especially since just a few months ago I was deciding if I was going to commit myself to run it! When I made my decision, my brother told me that it’ll come quick… and it sure has! Speaking of my brother, I just wanted to make a shout out to him for helping me so much with all of this. Not only is Maxx my manager, but he is a BIG reason I am even doing this race. Without his handy dandy skills of creating this website and planning the trip I wouldn’t be able to do it. I would also like to thank my father for helping me train for the biggest race of my life. He has sacrificed a lot to get me where I am. We’ve had our rough patches, but they say “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger”. You know who is strong, is my mother. She also is a big reason I am doing this. She makes me feel special and gives me all the advice I will ever need. I have the best family, they are so supportive and helpful.

          I’ve been doing a lot to train for this race. In the early months of training we started off by running 6 miles everyday with a day off on Sunday, just to start building up mileage. Then we added in a couple 8 milers during the week with a long run on Saturday which consisted of 10 to 12 milers. My dad works 5 days a week so I would have to wait to run with him until he got home after 6PM. Some nights were tougher than others and some nights were incredibly beautiful! Sometimes we didn’t even need to use our headlamps because the moon was so bright.

          One thing I learned through all my training days and hard workouts is that you aren’t going to have a good day unless you let yourself have a good day. If you go into a workout already dreading it you won’t have an easy time and it will feel like the end of the world. However if you go into the workout with a positive attitude and you keep telling yourself it’ll be a good day, you will truly succeed and be happy you stayed positive through it. With running and snowshoeing it is more mental than physical, you really have to believe in yourself, you have to trust that if you push a little harder it won’t hurt that bad.

          Thank you for checking in on me, and I hope you all are having a great new year and are achieving your goals! Everyone has been so supportive and it means the world! I’m excited to see where this trip takes me, and I’m so happy I decided to do this!
