      <h2>Hi, I'm Sig!</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          I’m a USSSA National Snowshoe Champion, runner, and student. I grew up in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, where our most valuable resources are the outdoors and snow. Since we have these two things in abundance, it was only natural that my family has always loved snowshoeing. When I was 10 years old, I ran my first snowshoe race, and 7 years later I became a USSSA National Champion!
        </p>
        <p>
          After my first title victory I joined the USSSA Snowshoe team, and was offered the incredible opportunity to travel to Japan for the World Snowshoe Championships in February! I've trained for months, and with the help of my friends, family, and local businesses, I will be traveling to Myoko to compete among the best snowshoers in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can't wait to share my journey with you!
